Then we skyped so I fully understood her points and recommendations. Together, we crafted a battle strategy for revisions—it was so efficient that the actual edits only took a week! And looking at the old draft versus the new one… wow. Her edits added a whole new dimension to my story, without sacrificing my original vision for the novel. If you’re hesitating on purchasing her work, don’t! After three _years_ of querying, it took my newly revised manuscript just three months to find a home with a literary agent. That’s all thanks to Carly\n\n<hr class=\"flower\" />\n\n-Rebecca Thorne, author of _This Gilded Abyss_ and _Can't Spell Treason Without Tea_\n"

She was able to see my vision and pinpoint exactly what was falling flat, what needed more development, what needed more consistency, and what needed more balance.\n\n>Better yet, she explained each of the issues in a clear way that made sense and inspired me to make changes in a smart way, to expand some threads and cut others and dig deeper into certain characters. Her notes were so thorough and helpful and well organized and well thought-out, that I was super excited to edit&mdash;those are the best sort of notes.\n\n>Carly is super professional, prompt, organized, concise, and so smart! I learned so much working with her, all of which has carried me through to later projects. I would totally recommend her to anyone.\n\n-Felicia Grossman, Author of <i>Appetites &amp; Vices</i>\n"

Then I handed it to Carly, who like me has a passion for the nexus where fantasy, science fiction and romance collide. With one read she saw the heart of the story I was trying to tell and helped me scrape away all the extraneous nonsense that didn’t belong. Carly’s insight into storytelling, how to lean into a writer’s voice, and the social issues that can make or break a story was invaluable. She helped uncover the light in my characters, leverage the characters as their own worst enemies, and breathe life into a complex tale that breaks the laws of physics. Her experience and empathy toward a writer’s struggle helped not only strengthen my story, but gave me the confidence to take chances I might have otherwise scooted under the rug. If you’re thinking about hiring her&mdash;don’t even hesitate. Carly is amazing as a person, as an editor, and as an instigator (seriously&mdash;she’s so subtle too), and she’ll help bring out the best in you and your story.\n\n-K. J.

That was the moment my querying journey altered course.\n\n>I can say without a doubt that working with Carly changed the trajectory of my writing and my life. Carly arranged a call to discuss my querying materials and to brainstorm on how to make them stronger and more marketable while staying true to my story. For starters, she helped categorize the genre and find stronger comp titles. Also, she gave me specific, actionable guidance on how to strengthen my query letter, synopsis, and first fifty pages.\n\n>When I re-entered the query trenches last autumn, I noticed an immediate difference.

As a non-native speaker, despite a high level of proficiency in English, there are still words whose usage I misunderstand or verbs I consistently conjugate wrong. My editor (Jessica Nelson) caught all those mistake and even gave me little crash courses in the comments, which truly helped me grow as a writer. They caught typos and inconsistencies left in my in-universe words, and I am truly impressed by how well they understood which of those fantasy words fit in which context. Ultimately, the choice to accept or reject edits remained mine, but I believe I found myself accepting edits again and again in a good 97% of cases. My manuscript came out of this endeavor polished and professional-looking, and I've learned a lot too. I believe I'll be back for more when I'm done writing my next book!\n\n-Lysle Enkelman"
