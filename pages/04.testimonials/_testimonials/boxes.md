The feedback is concise and easy to understand. Her willingness to discuss not just this first book but where I'm going in the series is a great help, the kind of support I need as I try something new.\n\n-Cheryl Harper, <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author of <i>Can't Help Falling in Love</i> and <i>Least Likely to Fall in Love</i>\n"

With Carly's guidance, I turned my pretty okay novel into something so much more&mdash;something alive. I always felt she loved my characters as much as I did; she simply got what I was trying to do, and helped me do it. I have no doubt that my book (and hopefully the many to come) is vastly improved by her involvement.\n\n-Kim Alexander, International best-selling author of The Demon Door series\n"

Then we skyped so I fully understood her points and recommendations. Together, we crafted a battle strategy for revisions—it was so efficient that the actual edits only took a week! And looking at the old draft versus the new one… wow. Her edits added a whole new dimension to my story, without sacrificing my original vision for the novel. If you’re hesitating on purchasing her work, don’t! After three _years_ of querying, it took my newly revised manuscript just three months to find a home with a literary agent. That’s all thanks to Carly!\n\n-Rebecca Thorne, author of _This Gilded Abyss_ and _Can't Spell Treason Without Tea_\n"

She was able to see my vision and pinpoint exactly what was falling flat, what needed more development, what needed more consistency, and what needed more balance.\n\n>Better yet, she explained each of the issues in a clear way that made sense and inspired me to make changes in a smart way, to expand some threads and cut others and dig deeper into certain characters. Her notes were so thorough and helpful and well organized and well thought-out, that I was super excited to edit&mdash;those are the best sort of notes.\n\n>Carly is super professional, prompt, organized, concise, and so smart! I learned so much working with her, all of which has carried me through to later projects. I would totally recommend her to anyone.\n\n-Felicia Grossman, Author of <i>Appetites &amp; Vices</i>\n"

        content: "><span class=\"first-character\">I</span>’d been building and writing my story _Bloodflower_ for more than a decade, and no matter how I revised, I couldn’t seem to make the story stand on its own feet. Then I handed it to Carly, who like me has a passion for the nexus where fantasy, science fiction and romance collide. With one read she saw the heart of the story I was trying to tell and helped me scrape away all the extraneous nonsense that didn’t belong. Carly’s insight into storytelling, how to lean into a writer’s voice, and the social issues that can make or break a story was invaluable. She helped uncover the light in my characters, leverage the characters as their own worst enemies, and breathe life into a complex tale that breaks the laws of physics. Her experience and empathy toward a writer’s struggle helped not only strengthen my story, but gave me the confidence to take chances I might have otherwise scooted under the rug. If you’re thinking about hiring her&mdash;don’t even hesitate. Carly is amazing as a person, as an editor, and as an instigator (seriously&mdash;she’s so subtle too), and she’ll help bring out the best in you and your story.\n\n-K. J. Harrowick, author of _Bloodflower_"

She's an incisive, thorough editor, and her notes were spot-on. She immediately understood the themes I wanted to convey and helped me bring them out by delving deeper into my heroine's psyche. My book ended up more exciting, more romantic, and more emotionally complex because of Carly's excellent feedback.\n\n>Overall, working with Carly was a dream. She was prompt with her notes and was the perfect mix of supportive and blunt about the manuscript's flaws. My manuscript is much better after her input, and I highly recommend working with her!\n\n-Sarah Hawley, represented by Jessica Watterson at Sandra Dijkstra Literary Agency\n"

Readers are really connecting with the emotional ride of my story, and I have Carly to thank for getting me to bring all those emotions to the fore in a compelling way. I’m a screenwriter by training, and she also gave me guidance that helped me flesh out my prose and wrap my head around the needs of a novel.

        content: "><span class=\"first-character\">I</span>'m really happy to have chosen Book Light Editorial for my manuscript. As a non-native speaker, despite a high level of proficiency in English, there are still words whose usage I misunderstand or verbs I consistently conjugate wrong. My editor (Jessica Nelson) caught all those mistake and even gave me little crash courses in the comments, which truly helped me grow as a writer. They caught typos and inconsistencies left in my in-universe words, and I am truly impressed by how well they understood which of those fantasy words fit in which context. Ultimately, the choice to accept or reject edits remained mine, but I believe I found myself accepting edits again and again in a good 97% of cases. My manuscript came out of this endeavor polished and professional-looking, and I've learned a lot too. I believe I'll be back for more when I'm done writing my next book!\n\n-Lysle Enkelman"

She returned the feedback within the time frame and I was blown away with how detailed the feedback letter was, clearly sectioned and with reference to specific sections in the story. I was able to apply her recommendations and make my novel much more streamlined and focused. Ultimately, it was enough to get the attention of my now agent and publisher.

Each time, she has given me greater insight into what I've put on the page, and she has helped me understand how readers, agents and publishers will see it.
