        content: "><span class=\"first-character\">I</span>'ve been lucky to work with several editors who've improved my books and made me a better writer. I appreciate Carly's style. The feedback is concise and easy to understand. Her willingness to discuss not just this first book but where I'm going in the series is a great help, the kind of support I need as I try something new.\n\n-Cheryl Harper, <i>USA Today</i> Bestselling Author of <i>Can't Help Falling in Love</i> and <i>Least Likely to Fall in Love</i>\n"

        content: "><span class=\"first-character\">I</span> met Carly the same day I saw Mad Max Fury Road, so she'll forever be linked in my mind to Furiosa--someone you absolutely want on your side! With Carly's guidance, I turned my pretty okay novel into something so much more, something alive. I always felt she loved my characters as much as I did--she simply got what I was trying to do, and helped me do it. I have no doubt that my book (and hopefully many to come) are vastly improved by her involvement.\n\n-Kim Alexander, International Bestselling Author of The Demon Door series\n"

        content: "><span class=\"first-character\">I</span> can’t rave about Carly enough! She performed a quick, yet thorough, read-through of my novel and created six _pages_ of talking points. Then we skyped so I fully understood her points and recommendations. Together, we crafted a battle strategy for revisions—it was so efficient that the actual edits only took a week! And looking at the old draft versus the new one… wow. Her edits added a whole new dimension to my story, without sacrificing my original vision for the novel. If you’re hesitating on purchasing her work, don’t! After three _years_ of querying, it took my newly revised manuscript just three months to find a home with a literary agent. That’s all thanks to Carly!\n\n-Rebecca Thorne, Young Adult Author, represented by the Corvisiero Literary Agency\n"

        content: "><span class=\"first-character\">I</span> had such a wonderful experience working with Carly&mdash;so fabulous that I worked with her twice&mdash;on two different manuscripts, both I adored and knew were close but not quite right. She was able to see my vision and pinpoint exactly what was falling flat, what needed more development, what needed more consistency, and what needed more balance.\n\n>Better yet, she explained each of the issues in a clear way that made sense and inspired me to make changes in a smart way, to expand some threads and cut others and dig deeper into certain characters. Her notes were so thorough and helpful and well organized and well thought-out, that I was super excited to edit&mdash;those are the best sort of notes.\n\n>Carly is super professional, prompt, organized, concise, and so smart! I learned so much working with her, all of which has carried me through to later projects. I would totally recommend her to anyone.\n\n-Felicia Grossman, Author of <i>Appetites &amp; Vices</i>\n"

        content: "><span class=\"first-character\">C</span>arly Bornstein-Hayward edited my YA fantasy manuscript, THE DYING CITY, during #RevPit 2018. She's an incisive, thorough editor, and her notes were spot-on. She immediately understood the themes I wanted to convey and helped me bring them out by delving deeper into my heroine's psyche. My book ended up more exciting, more romantic, and more emotionally complex because of Carly's excellent feedback.\n\n>Overall, working with Carly was a dream. She was prompt with her notes and was the perfect mix of supportive and blunt about the manuscript's flaws. My manuscript is much better after her input, and I highly recommend working with her!\n\n-Sarah Hawley, represented by Andrea Somberg at Harvey Klinger Inc.\n"

        content: "><span class=\"first-character\">W</span>hen I first approached Carly, I wasn’t sure my manuscript would ever be published. But with her gentle manner and supportive feedback, she helped me organize and re-write my story. She’s phenomenal at suggesting solutions, not just pointing out problems. With Carly, you know she is immediately on your team and your biggest cheerleader. After working with her on two books, I honestly felt like she knew my characters as well as I did. Carly is professional, positive and kind. Plus, she has a killer GIF game on Twitter!\n\n-Deana Birch, Romance Author\n"

        content: "><span class=\"first-character\">I</span> met Carly through [#RevPit 2017](http://reviseresub.com?target=_blank), submitting my YA Fantasy, Storm Rising, to her. From her first email, Carly has been a huge advocate of my work. She promised feedback on my submission even if she didn't pick me for the contest, and she followed through with such insightful feedback that I asked her to do a developmental edit on my novel. She returned the feedback within the time frame and I was blown away with how detailed the feedback letter was, clearly sectioned and with reference to specific sections in the story. I was able to apply her recommendations and make my novel much more streamlined and focused. Ultimately, it was enough to get the attention of my now agent and publisher. I know Carly played a large part in my dream of being published coming true.\n\n-Stuart White, Young Adult Author\n"

        content: "><span class=\"first-character\">L</span>aura helped me to fix the key complaint I received from beta readers: too many typos and style inconsistencies. Turns out the bugs were hidden in plain sight — you can never see your own typos! (If there’s a typo in this testimonial, that’s on me.) I have to add that, in addition to the necessary repairs, it was such fun seeing her reactions and encouragement noted throughout the text, sprinkled like Easter eggs. That human touch is important to me, as I’m primarily aiming my book at humans.\n\n-J.D. Robinson, Sci-fi and Young Adult Author\n"

        content: "><span class=\"first-character\">C</span>arly has completed two developmental edits for me within the past two years on two separate manuscripts. Both times I was impressed with not only the turn-around time, but how thorough her feedback was. She helped me see my projects from a reader's perspective but also offered advice on the marketability of it. Her enthusiasm for my work was met with a perfect balance of constructive criticism. While I had no doubt she's in my corner, she also wasn't afraid to challenge. Because of this, I'm able to put out the best work possible. Always a professional, she's also someone I can't wait to share a cuppa with someday.\n\n-Lissa Carlino, Author of <i>Woman Enough</i>\n"

        content: "><span class=\"first-character\">C</span>arly has given me outstanding feedback on my manuscript and I am extremely happy I found her. What I have loved about her critique is that she provides very concrete and easy to understand advice. She identified specific issues with my manuscript and then gave me ideas about how to fix them. Another thing I appreciate is that she gave me rationale for why certain things weren't working. Once I heard that the intro to my Romance was reading like a YA, I was all in.\n\n>In addition to the full manuscript, Carly has helped with my novel synopsis and she has reread revised sections of the manuscript. Each time, she has given me greater insight into what I've put on the page, and she has helped me understand how readers, agents and publishers will see it. All the while, she has been very encouraging and excited about my work. I couldn't hope for a better editor.\n\n-Bliss Esposito\n"

        content: "><span class=\"first-character\">I</span> worked with Carly as part of the Pitch to Publication contest and I am so grateful to have had the opportunity. She donated her time to edit my manuscript and helped hammer out the kinks and added a nice polish to the prose. She is a razor sharp editor and working together is a real partnership where you focus on the essentials: story, style, and character. She motivates you to elevate the material, trim the fat, and kill your darlings. Over the course of multiple drafts with Carly, my work improved immensely due to her feedback and suggestions. She'll even help craft a query letter that catches an agent's attention. I highly recommend working with this supportive and generous individual.\n\n-Kevin Curtis\n"

I'm oozing with excitement over the changes in my book. I loved my story before but now I'm in love with it. Carly's feedback is worth every penny. She thoughtfully committed to my characters and their struggles, highlighting the key issues that were keeping my writing from reaching its full potential. She challenged me to take on some dramatic changes and I can't thank her enough for the outcome. If you want to take your book to the next level, Carly is the editor for you. It also helps that she's a joy to work with.\n\n-Lindsay Burroughs\n"

We had a relatively short time to implement her suggestions due to contest constraints, but the critique she gave me was clear and concise.

Chronology, plot consistency, character motivation, authentic dialogue, point of view, word choices, etc. I appreciated the exhaustive detail and acuteness of her perceptions, but even more than that, I especially valued her understanding of my intent and my overall vision. She kept true to my vision for the novel and helped greatly in turning that vision into a reality.\n\n-Danny Davis, Historical YA author\n"
