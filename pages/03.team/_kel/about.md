<span class="first-character">K</span>el is Book Light Editorial's social media assistant, searching for the best way to deliver writing tips to fellow authors. When she's not spreading Book Light Editorial's wisdom, she's juggling too many drafts, gazing at blank word documents, and falling into the trap of endless revision (just one more round and it'll be perfect, right?) She lives in the Pacific Northwest and relishes in warm beverages on rainy days.

Pronouns: She/Her
