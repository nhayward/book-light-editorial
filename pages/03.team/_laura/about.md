#### Laura Dennison

_**Senior Copyeditor**_

<span class="first-character">L</span>aura has worked as a professional editor for 3 years. She has experience in both content and copyediting. Her copyediting services offer authors one crucial final set of eyes on their manuscript before being sent out—whether to an agent or for indie publication. Her goal is to help you produce a polished piece that you can be just as sure of as you are proud of.

She holds an MFA in Nonfiction from the Mountainview low-residency program, where she wrote a coming-of-age memoir under the mentorship of published authors and exstensively studied craft and publishing. She graduated from the University of New Hampshire magna cum laude with a BA in English. There, she focused her studies on print journalism, news editing, and fiction and nonfiction writing.

Laura lives in New Hampshire, where she cocoons herself in blankets and edits from her secondhand La-Z-Boy chair. When she’s not editing, you can find her working on her own writing, binge-watching America’s Next Top Model, or trying her hand at indoor rock-climbing.

!!!!! ##### Specialties:   
!!!!!   
!!!!! Laura’s specializes in YA and NA novels. She also loves editing coming-of-age stories, memoirs, and nonfiction essay collections. She does not edit horror, as she’s easily spooked, but is open to all other genres and manuscripts that deal with heavier subject matters.
