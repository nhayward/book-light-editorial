<span class="first-character">M</span>elissa Bergum is Book Light Editorial's over-caffeinated social media assistant, generating posts and playing with Canva a little too much some days. Outside of assisting Book Light Editorial, Melissa likes to dive into her own writing where she often gets lost in worlds filled with magic and whimsy and she hopes one day her books will end up in kidsâ€™ hands. As an avid nerd, Melissa enjoys all things Studio Ghibli, playing board games and D&D, and putting too many hours into Animal Crossing. She lives in Wisconsin with her husband, daughter, and two polar opposite cats.
