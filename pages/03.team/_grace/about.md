#### Grace Laidlaw

_**Senior Copyeditor**_

<span class="first-character">G</span>race has 7 years’ experience as a professional copyeditor and proofreader. She cleans up the typos, grammatical errors, and stylistic inconsistencies that even the best authors can’t always catch. She will make your manuscript as smooth as possible so that readers can lose themselves in it completely.

She spent several years as a Managing Editorial Assistant at HarperCollins Publishers, where she worked on manuscripts for _New York Times_ bestselling authors such as James Rollins, Mary Jane Clark, and Tessa Dare. Grace has also held editorial roles at several smaller academic and nonfiction presses. Her copyediting credits include everything from historical romance to postmodern memoir. She graduated Magna Cum Laude from Columbia University with bachelor’s degrees in Creative Writing and Psychology.

Grace lives in Brooklyn with her programmer boyfriend and their beloved pet couch. In her spare time, she’s usually watching _Jeopardy!_ (and loudly guessing the answers) or catching up on _Law & Order_ (and loudly guessing whodunit). 


!!!!! ##### Specialties:   
!!!!!   
!!!!! Grace specializes in adult and new adult fiction of all sorts, with particular emphasis on romance and erotica. She also enjoys both short- and long-form narrative nonfiction. Regardless of genre, a manuscript with sharply drawn characters and memorable settings will always pique her interest.
