Jessica has been a professional editor for 7 years, working with both traditionally published and indie authors.  She loves the cadence and texture of the written word, and she will help you smooth away embarrassing errors that can derail a scene. 

After earning a BA and MA in English, Jessica worked in higher education communications for several years before pursuing editing, the career she had always wanted. Many of her indie clients have gone on to win awards and secure publishing contracts, but she believes the strongest recommendation is the clients who have worked with her again and again over the years. She is a member of the Editorial Freelancers Association and is a four-time judge for the InD’Tale RONE awards.

When she isn’t editing or writing, she can be found starting (and occasionally finishing) art projects or binge-watching something. Jessica lives in the American South with her husband, two children, and a fluffy brindle dog who probably believes she’s human.
