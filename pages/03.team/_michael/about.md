<span class="first-character">M</span>ichael has been editing books for eight years at independent publishers, Big 5 houses, a literary agency, and as an independent contractor. He loves to live in a manuscript for days on end—improving its clarity, concision, style, and consistency—to ensure readers get that immersive experience we all crave when we turn a book cover.

After earning his BA in English and MS in book and online publishing, Michael worked at Fuse Literary, Simon & Schuster, W. W. Norton, and Penguin Random House. He now works independently with authors who are embarking on their publishing journeys. After roles in traditional houses, agencies, and indie publishing, Michael leverages his diverse and robust industry experience to elevate every book to its fullest editorial and commercial potential 

Whenever Michael manages to tear his eyes from the written word, he can be found illustrating, hiking, or baking too many cookies.
