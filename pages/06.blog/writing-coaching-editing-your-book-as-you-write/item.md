#### [by Carly Bornstein-Hayward](http://booklighteditorial.com/team#carly)

So you have a great idea for your next novel, but you're struggling to write it. Need some motivation? Writing coaching might be your answer! And now, by popular demand, I'm offering it as a new [service](/services) (woohoo!).

**Writing Coaching:** This is for authors that have a solid idea of what they want their book to be, but haven't written it yet. The editor encourages your writing and gives you advice as you write. They also shape the story arc, help you to organize your thoughts, clarify for the reader, and focus your story. In order to provide focused and equal time to all of the editor's monthly clients, they will set aside specific days to focus on your project and respond to your questions. Writing coaching includes two phone calls a month, detailed emailing once a week, and editing pages as you go. The first month includes outline writing and editing of the first twenty pages; every additional month includes fifty pages of editing.

Basically, once a week will be your day, and on that day we will email and chat (video, message, phone) to discuss your book, how the writing is going, and where to go next. I'll encourage your writing, push you further than you would normally go, and help edit the book as you go. With this service, you can usually forgo a developmental edit, because we do it as we go. It is a great option for writers, whether they are self-publishing or looking for representation.

Since this is such a personal collaboration, I will be selective about the books I take on. I want to make sure that I can help you enough for it to be worth your money, and that I am the right coach/editor for you. So we will have to have a discussion ahead of time to make sure we are a good fit! If you think this is something you are interested in, hit me up!

I can't wait to read all your lovely thoughts!
