Guess what authors?! I have good news! There is a new Twitter Pitch event run by a fabulous group of editors.

Unfortunately, it all started with some bad news. #P2P17 was postponed due to internal issues. All the editors that had planned on joining #P2P17 suddenly had an opening in their schedule. Instead of just going on a vacation like any sane person would do, we decided to host our own event!

Revise & Resub is an editor-run pitch contest focusing on helping authors get their book ready for querying.

##### Here's how it works:

Writers will submit their query and first 5 (double-spaced) pages to three editors (and one alternate) of their choice, who will then pick one (or if we're really masochistic, two!) winners. After that, the editors and their chosen authors will get to work on their manuscripts in a month-long editing session. And finally, we will repost the polished submissions for the Showcase.
