title: 'Livestream Critique with Author Rebecca Thorne'
---

A few weeks ago the lovely Rebecca Thorne invited me to join her weekly livestream critique of the 1st 5 pages of works-in-progress. It is part of her Let's Get Published! Discord server where authors can talk about all things writing and publishing. 

Every week she is joined by a different person on her livestream to help authors hone their writing, especially the all important 1st 5 pages! Watch below to get our tips on writing!
