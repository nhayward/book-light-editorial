Being a winner comes with perks, but Coach Jack Ford wants something more than a fat paycheck, fancy parties, and big house. He's moved to small-town Lincoln to do what he loves: teach kids. He's seen firsthand how sports programs can change lives.

Nina had them at "I Do" but Jack walked away. When she blows into town with one last play, sonogram in hand, they're going to have to find a way they both can win.
