Voice is one of the trickiest and most nebulous elements of storytelling, but it's also an invaluable quality that makes your books uniquely *yours.* Here are some tips on how to develop and refine your writing voice!

**Tip 1:** Voice is demonstrated via tone, word choice, sentence structure, paragraph structure, use of description, exposition, narration, dialogue, pacing, themes, character archetypes, even subject matter. 

**Tip 2:** Expect "your" voice to shine through in each book, even when your books' narrators have unique voices. It's similar to how you have a distinct voice in conversation, even if you speak differently with a boss, a sibling, or a friend.

**Tip 3:** Experiment and try writing the same scene with different voices! For example, attempt the following: a logical narrator, a goofy voice, a distracted storyteller, a scared one. 

**Tip 4:** If there's a voice you admire as a reader, try mimicking the style to see if any part of it agrees with you as a writer.

**Tip 5:** While reading, pay attention to the voice of the book in your hands. Read two books by the same author and determine their similarities and differences. 

**Tip 6:** Let go of how you "should" write for a moment and write however you'd like. What "rules" do you want to break? What if you made the choice to break them knowingly? 

**Tip 7:** Find your strengths as a writer (what you enjoy reading and writing, what parts of your writing are frequently praised) and then push those strengths to emphasize your voice.

**Tip 8:** Take it slow: gaining experience and mastering the craft will reveal your voice over time. 

**Tip 9:** Remember that you will have a harder time recognizing your voice than anyone else - outside perspective will really help! 

!!!!! And a bonus tip - look for an editor who appreciates your voice and wants to help nurture it! Not all editors are a fit for all voices. Check out our [services page](/services) to see if Book Light Editorial might be a good fit for you and your books!
