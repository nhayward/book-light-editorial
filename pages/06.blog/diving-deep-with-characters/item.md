title: 'Diving Deep with Characters'

Hey, everyone! In July, our topic was “Diving Deep with Characters!” This was such a fun topic to delve into, since characters are the life of your story. They are who your readers connect with, what makes readers keep turning the pages, they are the backbone of your story. Without interesting characters, you lose your reader even before you start, so let’s delve into the tips we discussed in July!

Writing is all about creating awesome characters, people that feel real and leave a big imprint on your readers. In the age-old argument between what’s more important, plot or character, characters almost always win. That’s because the best plot won’t even start until your character rises to the challenge. Readers need someone to root for. So let’s talk characters!
 
In this day and age, it’s more important than ever to focus on character diversity. Every person has a slightly different story to tell, and that can be shown in your character creation. Giving your characters a wide range of cultures, ethnicities, traits, disabilities, and sexual orientations will make your book feel, well, real.
 
One of the most important things to note about character creation is that every character—_**every**_ character—must want something. And as all these people swarm each other, hunting for that thing they want, conflict is naturally going to form. Weaving inside jokes, grudges, and romance into your web of characters as they pursue their dreams is a great way to add depth!
 
Finally, pay attention to how your character is created. Use personality tests and birth order to determine base traits, and add bulk through traumatic events, happy moments, and everything in between. Avoid tropes and stereotypes. Give them one big flaw to solve. Then watch them soar off the page!
