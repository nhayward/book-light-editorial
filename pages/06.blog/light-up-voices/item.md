![Light Up Voices](LightUpVoices.png?cropResize=700,700){.center}

###### Originally post February 2nd, 2021. Updated July 26th, 2022 to adjust frequency of the giveaway.

Enter now to receive a free Light Up Voices package, this offer is open **only** to members of marginalized communities.

### Details: 

I will randomly choose one author every three months (four winners a year) to receive the Light Up Voices package. You can apply at any time; this offer never closes!

You do not need to apply every quarter; your application is good for a whole year. After which, you can apply again. _(If you are chosen and have shelved the manuscript you may choose a different project or forego the evaluation and we’ll choose someone else.)_

If you want to be considered for this opportunity, apply now!

[Apply Here](https://forms.gle/ACdAMBCr54vDtixE8?target=_blank) {.button}

### What it includes: 

A 50-page evaluation, a list of next steps, as well as a 30-min coaching call. 

 * An evaluation is an in-depth analysis that will help you refine your writing by discussing big-picture edits. It will look at story arc, character development, conflict, pacing, voice, plot, consistency, and more! You will receive a letter full of actionable feedback that breaks down the strengths and weaknesses in the first 50 pages of your manuscript.

While I can’t guarantee success, hopefully this will help make your writing stronger for this manuscript and future projects.

!!!!! **Note:** _All entries will remain **anonymous**, as we don’t want to out anyone publicly, but you can feel free to talk about it on your own social media._
!!!!! 
!!!!! _I have **no** copyright interest in the work and the author is free to use any of my suggestions, edits, and ideas without reservation._
