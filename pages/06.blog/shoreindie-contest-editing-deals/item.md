#### by Carly Hayward

The ShoreIndie contest has now moved to the editing round, and as a thank-you to all the authors for making the ShoreIndie community so warm and fun, I'm offering a few editing deals! You just need to book by **August 15th, 2017** (editing dates may fall later).

If you haven't heard about ShoreIndie, check it out [here](https://shoreindie.blogspot.com/p/about.html?target=_blank)!

#### I’m offering two tiers of deals:

##### For the entire ShoreIndie community

If you submitted to anyone in the contest or talked with us on Twitter using the #ShoreIndie hashtag, you are welcome to take advantage of these specials.

**ShoreIndie Full Developmental Edit - _10% off_**

When you have taken your piece as far as you can on your own, it is time for a developmental edit. This edit will help you refine your writing by working on story structure, pacing, character development, voice, clarity, and plot. It looks at the big picture as well as writing technique. This results in a 5- to 8-page letter itemizing improvements to your manuscript as well as comprehensive in-line edits that point to problems within the manuscript and helps improve your writing at a sentence level.

**ShoreIndie Manuscript Assessment with a _Free_ In-Line Chapter Edit**

If you are on a tight budget or are looking for a developmental editor’s eye without the in-line edits, then you want a manuscript assessment. The editor will read your manuscript and send back an in-depth critique discussing big-picture edits. This can be for completed or unfinished works depending on what stage you want the editor to review it. Typically, this results in a 5- to 8-page letter but no in-line edits, but with this deal you get a free in-line edit of one chapter. You’ll be able to take those notes and apply it to the rest of your work.

##### For authors who submitted to me during ShoreIndie

The following deals are only available to authors whose submission I received during the ShoreIndie contest. These authors can also take advantage of the previous deals listed (although there is only one other deal not listed in this section).
