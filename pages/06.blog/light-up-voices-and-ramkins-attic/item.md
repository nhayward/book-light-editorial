## Ramkin’s Attic in cooperation with Book Light Editorial

Ramkin’s Attic is a funds for authors, by authors, intent on eliminating hurdles on the road to self-publishing. We are currently focused on sponsoring editorial costs for marginalized indie authors, since the world needs more diverse storytelling, never less.

### Who can apply?

Any marginalized indie author (ex. LGBTQA+, POC, disabled, or other historically marginalized communities) looking for financial aid for editorial services, with the goal of self-publishing their fiction manuscript. The manuscript must be complete before applying.

(As the intent is to lessen hurdles, not add to them, Ramkin’s Attic will never demand proof of marginalization, nor economic status. Please apply fairly.)

While Ramkin’s Attic hopes to fund more in the future, we are currently able to aid two authors.
 
### What kind of editorial services are currently sponsored?

Ramkin’s Attic is immensely grateful to be partnering with Carly Hayward, who is offering to work with authors via The Glow Package. In this instance, Carly will accept fiction manuscripts that are: Adult or Young Adult Fantasy, Sci-fi, Mystery, or Romance (all sub-genres and cross-genres included therein).

A Glow Package includes a manuscript evaluation that provides you with actionable, in-depth feedback, as well as a second-round review after you implement changes.It will look at story arc, character development, conflict, pacing, voice, plot, consistency, and more! It is the perfect edit for all types of authors because it helps you grow as a writer beyond one manuscript while still improving your piece. This results in a 7- to 15-page evaluation, a follow-up 4- to 6-page critique of your edited manuscript, and a 1-hour coaching call.

### Where and when do I apply?

Applications will be open from December 16th, 2024 to January 16th, 2025.
