It's time for another #RevPit #10Queries post! In case you missed my last one, you can find it [here](https://booklighteditorial.com/blog/query-advice-from-revpit-10queries-event).

Query writing can seem impossible. You have to fit so much in to one page: summarize your story, hook the agent, make it seem marketable, and include a bio.

\#RevPit is here to help you (along with tons of other amazing Twitter pitch events)!

This month, we threw a #10Queries event where editors reviewed submissions from 10 writers. We then tweeted our thoughts on each submission in the hopes that it will help others learn from them. Below you can find a thread with all my queries and advice!

I&#39;m so excited. Honestly, most of these were great and had small things wrong. There are quiet a few that I really want to read. I&#39;m so excited about all of them! <a href="https://t.co/ZuR2kqUWsj">pic.twitter.com/ZuR2kqUWsj</a></p>&mdash; Carly Hayward, Editor (@FromCarly) <a href="https://twitter.com/FromCarly/status/1224407586096676865?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
