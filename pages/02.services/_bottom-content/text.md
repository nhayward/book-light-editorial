##### Additional Information:

We recommend asking for a sample edit to make sure we are a good fit for you. All editors work differently and one may be more compatible with your vision than another. If we find we arenâ€™t a good match, we try to recommend someone better suited. Our sample edits cost $25 for the first 5 pages (later deducted from the full service if booked).

Payment is accepted through PayPal after the editor has sent you an invoice, and you will receive a final quote after the work is reviewed.

Rush edits will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

We book out far in advance, so contact us today to get your spot on our calendar!

##### Promotion:

When you publish your work all you have to do is let us know and it will be tweeted, blogged about, and posted all over the internet!
