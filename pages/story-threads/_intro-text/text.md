## Unravel your characters and their worlds.

### Join Jeni Chapelle, Tiffany Grimes, and Carly Hayward as they pull at the threads that form your character and help you craft a fully developed story.

### February 4-7 2021  
 
For four days, work with these three professional editors to explore every aspect of writing three-dimensional characters, from inception, into drafting, and through revisions. Story Threads: Unraveling Character will help you bring new depth and dimension to every character you create. This retreat includes a deep dive on major topics that influence characters, as well as discussions and exercises on:
 * Creating realistic and well-developed characters
 * How characters and plot influence each other
 * Defining your characterâ€™s internal and external struggles
 * And more!
 
**And of course, plenty of time for writing.**

_**All participants will also receive feedback on 10 pages of their manuscript from one of our professional editors + other writers at the retreat.**_
