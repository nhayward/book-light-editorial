# Editing Bookmarks

##### Here you'll find our bookmark printables. Reading is a great way to strengthen your own writing because you can analyze what works and why it is working. These bookmarks will help you remember to keep an eye out for certain story elements. You can use our general editing bookmark for the most common elements to keep an eye out for, or you use the more specific ones if you're looking to work on a certain writing element.
