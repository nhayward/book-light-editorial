February’s theme was LOVE LANGUAGES, and whew, we had a lot of fun with this one! We hit so many points, but we’re excited to summarize. 

We chose the theme of Love Languages partly because of February, but mostly because it can really help make a character feel real. These personality tests may seem silly, but by throwing them together—introvert or extrovert, which Myers Briggs personality, what attachment style, their star sign, etc—you can really layer a characters’ response to their environment. 

For example, if you have an introvert who’s also Physical Touch, they might be shy looking for that connection outside of their home. How does that affect their mental state? Are they more anxious because of it? Desperate and lonely? Or do they have a few friends who hug them all the time, so they’re fulfilled inside? 

By considering these things, it only makes your writing easier. It’s fine to establish a character as a certain trope (ie: the Bad Boy), but if you’re going to make them believable, that has to simply be a front. Taking a Bad Boy, then giving him the Words of Affirmation love language means that suddenly, this leather-jacket and aviators guy is writing poems to his crush. Suddenly, he’s a lot more engaging! 

This month was such a fun theme, and we hope you consider love languages as you’re setting personalities to your characters!

Check out some of the highlights from this month, and happy writing!
