### What personal data we collect and why we collect it

#### Comments

When visitors leave comments on Book Light Editorial, we collect the data shown in the comments form, the visitor’s IP address and browser-user agent string to help spam detection.

All comments are collected through Disqus. Their privacy policy can be viewed [here](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717103-disqus-privacy-policy?target=_blank). After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

#### Cookies

If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.

If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.

When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select "Remember Me", your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.

If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.

#### Embedded content from other websites

Articles on Book Light Editorial may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

#### Analytics

Book Light Editorial is monitored by Google Analytics.

### Who we share your data with

Book Light Editorial will never distribute or sell your information to third parties.

### How long we retain your data

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

### What rights you have over your data

If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

### Where we send your data

Visitor comments may be checked through our automated spam detection service. Apart from data gathering listed above, Book Light Editorial will never distribute or sell your information to third parties.
