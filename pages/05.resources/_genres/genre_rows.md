      #### Romance

      The romance genre has many subgenres, but most importantly, they all involve romantic love. A novel fits into the romance genre if the main plot revolves around a romantic relationship, even if other subplots present conflict and story. A key component in all romance novels is the happily-ever-after (HEA) or the happily-for-now (HFN). The novel must end with one or the other in order to satisfy the genre. 

      **Some subgenres include:**
      * Contemporary
      * Historical
      * Romantic suspense
      * Fantasy
      * Paranormal
      * Military
      * Inspirational
      * Time travel

      #### Mystery

      Mystery novels often involve a detective solving a conundrum or case. The story should be full of clues, red herrings, and—obviously—mysteries. The story starts with an unknown that hooks the reader in, and the main character must solve the unknown by the end of the novel. The reader should be trying to solve the mystery along with the characters. Thrillers have a lot of crossover with mystery novels and can be considered a subgenre (albeit typically darker and more suspenseful one). 

      **Some subgenres include:**
      * Bumbling detective
      * Cozy
      * Amateur sleuth
      * Caper
      * Hard-boiled
      * Historical
      * Legal
      * Police procedural
      * (Sometimes) thriller
