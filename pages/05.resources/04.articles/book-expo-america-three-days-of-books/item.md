#### by Carly Bornstein-Hayward

It's that time of year where everyone in the book publishing industry gets together and discusses books. What could be better? NOTHING (excuse the caps lock, I get really into capitalization when I'm excited).

If you are an author and have thought about getting out there, networking, meeting others, then you should definitely consider coming to BEA. It is a great resource for anyone interested in learning about the book industry and all the complexities therein. You can learn about genre definitions, pitching, readership trends, and much more.

There are signings, events, and panels. If you want to stop by and say hi, I'll be at the EFA Booth and I'll be speaking at a panel Thursday morning. If you are an author that wants to learn about editing, my panel (called: [The Editorial Process: What Do Editors Do?](http://www.bookexpoamerica.com/en/Sessions/26952/The-Editorial-Process-What-Do-Editors-Do?target=_blank)) would be perfect for you. Here is a description from the BEA site:

_Good editing can be the difference between a so-so book and a book that succeeds. Learn about all the important editorial functions, from developmental editing through to proofreading, that go into a well-crafted book. A panel of experienced freelance editors, all members of the Editorial Freelancers Association (EFA), explain what they do and why itâ€™s so important for your book. Panelists will also discuss how to find and hire the right freelancers for your project._

I'll be joined by some seriously talented editors on the uPublishU Stage at 10:30. Many of the panels will be live-streamed by a PBS affiliate, if you can't make it! I hope to meet a lot of you there!
