##### From the Back Cover:

**"A unicorn walks into a bar..."**

That is not a joke.

Look, I'm a bartender, I have nothing to do with the xenos. I don't care if it's an elf or a vampire. As long as they don't bother me, I steer clear. I have my reasons. You can see them in the scars on my neck.

I never wanted to get involved. But my life changed for the second time when I saved the life of a unicorn. I made an enemy of something old--old and evil, and whatever it was, it'll be back for another try. I also made a friend when I decided to help March. **He's only been a human man for a day.** I'm responsible for him now. He's my friend...and, maybe something more. Maybe a lot more.

It doesn't matter to me that he isn't magical anymore.

I don't care if he's not PURE.

But, he does.
