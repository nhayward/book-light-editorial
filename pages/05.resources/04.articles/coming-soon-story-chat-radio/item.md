Big news everyone! I have teamed up with the amazing Jeni Chappelle to start a writing-focused podcast. 

===

![](StoryChatRadio%20-%20without%20movie%20screen_small.png){.float-left}

Let me introduce you to Story Chat Radio. During our podcast we'll be discussing a different movie every month and what you can learn from it to improve your writing. We'll talk story structure, character development, genres, and so much more! At the end of each podcast we'll critique a query/blurb that relates to the movie. 

Learn more about our upcoming episodes and how to submit your query/blurb at [storychatradio.com](https://www.storychatradio.com?target=_blank).
