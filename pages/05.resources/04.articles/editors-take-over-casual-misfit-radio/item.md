Recently, the [#RevPit](https://reviseresub.com?target=_blank) Editors teamed up and took over the amazing [Casual Misfit Radio](https://www.wecasualmisfits.com?target=_blank). 

===

Kyle V. Hiller hosts and is joined by r.r. campbell, Editor Cassandra, and me (Carly Hayward) to discuss bridging the gap between writers and editors. We dive into when the time is right to hire an editor, what stops writers from reaching out, and we even tackle imposter syndrome and staying strong through rejections when publishing. 

To listen to it and hear even more fabulous episodes, visit [Casual Misfits Radio](https://www.wecasualmisfits.com/listen/episode-13-revise-resub-rewrite-rihanna?target=_blank) or listen to this episode here:

Writing is a very personal activity and finding an editor you can trust to dive into your words can feel impossible. Listening to this podcast might make you feel less lost in the world of publishing. 

You can do it!
