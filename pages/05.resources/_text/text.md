##Genres{.center}

#### Sci-Fi
The science fiction genre involves elements based on science and technology. Stories can take place in an imaginary world or in an altered version of our current world, at times involving futuristic societies. Sci-fi is a subgenre of speculative fiction, along with fantasy and dystopia. 

**Some subgenres include:**
 * Alternate history
 * Steampunk
 * Time travel
 * Space opera
 * Soft sci-fi
 * Robotic/artificial intelligence
 * Space travel

#### Fantasy

Fantasy novels take place in an imaginary world that often includes magic or magical elements. It is a subgenre of speculative fiction, along with sci-fi and dystopia. Fantasy has many different subgenres of its own, including urban fantasy and contemporary fantasy. In these subgenres, stories take place in our world—only a slightly altered version that can include magic or mythological/supernatural creatures.

**Some subgenres include:**
 * Dark fantasy
 * High fantasy
 * Contemporary
 * Urban
 * Mythological
 * Historical

#### Romance

The romance genre has many subgenres, but most importantly, they all involve romantic love. A novel fits into the romance genre if the main plot revolves around a romantic relationship, even if other subplots present conflict and story. A key component in all romance novels is the happily-ever-after (HEA) or the happily-for-now (HFN). The novel must end with one or the other in order to satisfy the genre. 

**Some subgenres include:**
 * Contemporary
 * Historical
 * Romantic suspense
 * Fantasy
 * Paranormal
 * Military
 * Inspirational
 * Time travel

#### Mystery

Mystery novels often involve a detective solving a conundrum or case. The story should be full of clues, red herrings, and—obviously—mysteries. The story starts with an unknown that hooks the reader in, and the main character must solve the unknown by the end of the novel. The reader should be trying to solve the mystery along with the characters. Thrillers have a lot of crossover with mystery novels and can be considered a subgenre (albeit typically darker and more suspenseful one). 

**Some subgenres include:**
 * Bumbling detective
 * Cozy
 * Amateur sleuth
 * Caper
 * Hard-boiled
 * Historical
 * Legal
 * Police procedural
 * (Sometimes) thriller

#### There are many other genres out there. We can always discuss which genre best fits your novel, but some more genres include:

* Dystopian
* Thriller/Suspense
* Horror
* Literary Fiction
* Historical Fiction
* Magical Realism

**Disclaimer:** Many genres overlap and can be subgenres of each other. The above breakdown is not set in stone. 

Your novel likely crosses over into multiple genres, but it is important to find the one genre that fits the main plot of your book.
